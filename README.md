**'Hangman' game**

User is shown a random word from a file. Once the game is initialised, as per user's guess for each alphabet, game progresses. Hangman's image keeps on updated corresponding to each wrong guess. Make sure to complete the word before you run out of allowed wrong guesses and the poor man gets hung.

This was coded by me in the last semester of my B.Tech (Jan 2012).
